### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ricci Gian Maria and I'm a passionate developer since I've got my first computer (Commodore Vic 20). 

You can read my blog at [https://codewrecks.com](https://codewrecks.com) or follow me on twitter [@alkampfer](https://www.twitter.com/alkampfer).

I've also a [channel on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@codewrecks) where I store some video on technology.
